# Online Warband Creator for Song of Blades and Heroes

_Song of Blades and Heroes_ (SBH) is a slim, easy to learn, fast play, skirmish level fantasy tabletop rule system by Andrea Sfiligoi, published by Ganesha Games (https://www.ganeshagames.net). With this system, figures from any manufacturer at any scale can be used. Besides a ton of prefactured unit profiles, players can create their own units with any abilities ("special rules") they see fit.

## Developer's notes
This project started as zero-resources, minimum-code vanilla JavaScript, meaning no third party libraries or frameworks or any non-HTML/CSS/JS resources were used. Meanwhile it advanced in design, features and code architecture, using some libraries I developed for other projects and also using external resources such as Google Fonts or FontAwesome.

Functionality is tested with the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome as Windows desktop and Android mobile versions (and rarely even on Microsoft Edge). I expect users to always have the latest version of their browser installed - for their own sake. I do not do workarounds for issues caused by a browsers poor implementation of JavaScript or CSS.

Versioning does not follow the usual sequences, but versions are numbered after the year and month of their release.
