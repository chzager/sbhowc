## Development notes ##
This project is vanilla JavaScript, meaning no third party libraries are used.

Functionality is tested with the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome (may work with Microsoft Edge or on iOS, but I don't care).

Versioning does not follow the usual sequences but versions are numbered after the year and month of their release.
